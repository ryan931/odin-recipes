        <li>2 large skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup flour</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>¾ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>½ cup light olive oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>Jar of marinara</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
            Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Gently pound chicken breasts between 2 layers
            of plastic until each breast is evenly thick.
            Place breasts on a plate and season 1 side
            with kosher salt and black pepper. Sprinkle
            with flour; press flour to coat the entire
            surface and help it adhere. Turn and repeat on
            second side with salt, pepper, and flour.</li>
        <li>Brush excess flour from plate; place the
            chicken breasts back on the plate. Pour beaten
            egg over the breasts and coat each side. Cover
            bottom of a second plate with half the bread
            crumbs. Transfer chicken to the bread crumbs.
            Push crumbs up sides of chicken. Sprinkle on the
            remaining crumbs and thoroughly coat each side.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a skillet over
            medium-high heat. Cook chicken until crispy and
            golden, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to
            prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Top with fresh mozzaerlla and grated parmesian.</li>
        <li>Bake on center rack of preheated oven until
            cheese is melted and chicken is no longer pink
            in the center and the juices run clear, 10 to 12
            minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted
            into the center should read at least 165
            degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To serve, ladle the heated marinara sauce in a
            wide circle on warm plates. Place chicken in
            center and sprinkle with grated parm.</li>
    </ol>
